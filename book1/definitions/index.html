                Book 1 of the Elements begins with a number of axioms that form the basis of the reasoning that is followed through the rest of the book. 
                It is imperative that these definitions be understood if the work as a whole is to be understood.

                    "A point is that of which there is no part." <br>
                    This means is a point is a geometric entity that has no length or breadth. A point could be described as a 0-dimensional entity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "And a line is a length without breadth."
                </li>
                <li>"And the extremities of a line are points."</li>
                <li>"A straight line is (any) on which lies evenly with points on itself."</li>
                <li>"And a surface is that which has length and breadth only"</li>
                <li>"And the extremities of a surface are lines."</li>
                <li>"A plane surface is (any) one which lies evenly with the straight-lines on itself."</li>
                <li>
                    "And a plane angle is the inclination of the lines to one another, when two lines in a plane meet one another, and are 
                    not lying in a straight-line.
                </li>
                <li>"And when the lines containing the angle are straight then the angle is called rectilinear."</li>
                <li>
                    "And when a straight-line stood upon (another) straight-line makes adjacent angles (which are) equal to one another, each of the 
                    equal angles is a right-angle, and the former straight-line is called a perpendicular to that upon which it stands."
                </li>
                <li>"An obtuse angle is one greater than a right-angle."</li>
                <li>"And an acute angle (is) one less than a right-angle."</li>
                <li>A boundary is that which is the extremity of something"</li>
                <li>"A figure is that which is contained by some boundary or boundaries."</li>
                <li>
                    "A circle is a plane figure contained by a single line [which is called a circumference], (such that) all of the straight-lines 
                    radiating towards [the circumference] from one point amongst those lying inside the figure are equal to one another."
                </li>
                <li>"And the point is called the center of the circle."</li>
                <li>
                    "And a diameter of the circle is any straight-line, being drawn through the center, and terminated in each direction by the 
                    circumference of the circle. (And) any such (straight-line) also cuts the circle in half."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "And a semi-circle is the figure contained by the diameter and the circumference cuts off by it. And the center of the 
                    semi-circle is the same (point) as (the center of) the circle."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Rectilinear figures are those (figures) contained by straight-lines: trilateral figures being those contained by three 
                    straight-lines, quadrilateral by four, and multi-lateral by more than four."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "And of the trilateral figures: an equilateral triangle is that having three equal sides, an isosceles (triangle) that having 
                    only two equal sides, and a scalene (triangle) that having three unequal sides."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "And further of the trilateral figures: a right-angled triangle is that having a right-angle, an obtuse-angled (triangle) 
                    that having an obtuse angle, and an acute-angled (triangle) that having three acute angles."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "And of the quadrilateral figures: a square is that which is right-angled and equilateral, a rectangle that which is 
                    right-angled but not equilateral, a rhombus that which is equilateral but not right-angled, and a rhomboid that having opposite 
                    sides and angles equal to one another which is neither right-angled nor equilateral. And let quadrilateral figures besides 
                    these be called trapezia."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Parallel lines are straight-lines which, being in the same plane, and being produced to infinity in each direction, meet with 
                    one another in neither (of these directions)."
